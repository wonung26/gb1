### What is availability?[#](broken-reference) <a href="#what-is-availability" id="what-is-availability"></a>

**Availability** is the percentage of time that some service or infrastructure is accessible to clients and is operated upon under normal conditions. For example, if a service has 100% availability, it means that the said service functions and responds as intended (operates normally) all the time.

#### Measuring availability[#](broken-reference) <a href="#measuring-availability" id="measuring-availability"></a>

Mathematically, availability, `A`, is a ratio. The higher the `A` value, the better. We can also write this up as a formula:

A (in percent) = (Total Time −Amount Of Time Service Was Down)Total Time∗100\frac{(Total\ Time\ - Amount\ Of\ Time\ Service\ Was\ Down)}{Total\ Time} \* 100

We measure availability as a number of nines. The following table shows how much downtime is permitted when we’re using a given number of nines.
